This project focused on improving, updating, and merging existing microservices to make them faster and easier to maintain. I set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically test and deploy a single app that manages all four separate microservices, making updates smooth and development more efficient in a cloud-based environment.

🚨 The same repository: https://github.com/AmineBarguellil7/masterData-K8s was used for deploying the whole app, both front-end and back-end, on a local Kubernetes cluster using Docker Desktop and for deployment on AWS.
On 𝐀𝐖𝐒, I utilized 𝐄𝐂𝟐 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬 as 𝐊𝐮𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐬 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐫 𝐧𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐬 for scalable processing, deployed within 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐞𝐟𝐚𝐮𝐥𝐭 𝐕𝐏𝐂 that provided predefined subnets for simplified networking. To secure the application, I configured 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩𝐬 to manage traffic flow and control access to services running on the worker nodes, ensuring robust network protection and isolation.
